<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been a business owner my whole life. Starting in the Car Wash industry, I've owned and operated several different washes and a manufacturing company building equipment and chemicals. </p>

<p>I have also owned businesses in other industries and been in sales as well. Most of my tech knowledge come from the Car Wash industry though. I have programmed PLC's and done many other things in the industry. </p>

<p>I decided to get into Web Development programming in 2024 when I found a course online that fit my style of learning. Since finding the course I have done several projects and am really enjoying the programming industry. I look forward to getting better by the day and being able to program various different things.</p>
